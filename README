QUICKSTART:
At the command line with a GCC compiler, do the following

make clean all
./TSP

USAGE:
1. Upon running our project, a command window should pop up which prompts the
user for the # of runs, W, H, and N.
2. Enter desired parameters for W, H, N, and # of runs
3. Be patient, for large inputs, TSP1p5 can take between 300-400 seconds
4. As a bonus, averages, means, and standard deviations of runtimes for MST, TSP2,
and TSP1p5 will be printed after all trials have been completed.
